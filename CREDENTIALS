The tool operates as a series of modules, which probe social media sites. All of the existing modules require credentials in order to operate. These are developer credentials associated with the relevant social network. 

Credentials should be placed in separate files for each module, with each credential component placed on the same line, separated by a single space. For example, the Facebook module requires an APPLICATION TOKEN and a USER TOKEN, so the credentials file should appear as

> cat fb_cred.config
APPLICATION_TOKEN USER_TOKEN
> 

Guidance on where to find these credentials is provided below for each module. 


############
# Facebook #
############

For Facebook, the credentials required are an APPLICATION TOKEN and a developer's USER TOKEN.

To get the APPLICATION TOKEN:

1. Go to http://developers.facebook.com

2. Under 'My Apps' (top-right), select 'Add a New App'

3. Fill in the various required details. Treat the tool as a 'Website' application.

4. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools/accesstoken/

5. The APPLICATION TOKEN should be visible under the application's name, labelled 'App Token'. 


To get the USER TOKEN:

1. Go to https://developers.facebook.com/tools/accesstoken/

2. Next to the App Token is the User Token box. Click on the 'grant permission' link in this box.

3. A USER TOKEN will be created. This token will expire, but it is possible to extend the lifetime granted by clicking 'Debug' and then 'Extend Access'.

# Twitter  #
############

For Twitter, all four of CONSUMER KEY, CONSUMER SECRET, USER TOKEN, and USER SECRET are required.

1. Go to https://apps.twitter.com/ and select the 'new app' option. Fill in the details to create the app.

2. Returning to the same page, select your app to reach the settings.

3. Under Application Settings, select 'manage keys and access tokens' (in the Consumer Key box).

4. CONSUMER KEY and CONSUMER SECRET should now be visible under 'Application Settings'. The USER TOKEN and USER SECRET are to be found under 'Your Access Token', labelled as 'Access Token' and 'Access Token Secret' respectively. Permissions on both the API and access token should be read-only.



############
# Google+  #
############

For Google, a SERVER KEY is required.

1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/ and create a new project.

2. At the 'Overview' page, find and enable the Google+ API for this project.

3. Select 'Credentials' on the left hand side. The SERVER KEY should be present.

As with Twitter, all four of CONSUMER KEY, CONSUMER SECRET, USER TOKEN and USER SECRET are required.
